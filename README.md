In the Git + GitHub training were presented notions from starting with what is a branch, Git flow, best practices and some useful commands.
GitHub allows collaboration between developers when they are working on the same project and also offers a user-friendly interface that can be used to solve the conflicts.
From this training I have recalled the notions learned like creating a gitignore file to ignore all the files having a certain extension.
